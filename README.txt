Hi and welcome to my Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master Companion tool
With this tool a starting DM take some of the workload during a game session and leave it to my simple tool

This tool was designed to help those who want easy acces to the entire Monster Compenium, and add players to the tool to keep track of current players


-----HOW TO START-----
In the current version of the tool you'll have to run it on Tomcat, on a localhost server as i have yet to launch it on a server

After starting up you will be greeted by a login screen. There is a button where you can register an account. After registering you can use that login to login into the system

Then you'll see the main screen. On the left you have a search bar that updates itself while searching for a monster
Fun suggestions are:
    -dragon
    -goblin
    -polar bear
    -or even a Tyrannosaurus Rex! (or type rex if you dont wanna type Tyrannosaurus)

After clicking on your desired monster you'll see all the necessary statistics of that monster on your right.
During a gaming session as a DM, your monster will be slain by your party, so if they take damage, you can change the amount of hit points the monster has remaining
Is your monster truly dead by the hands of powerful player, no worries! You can delete that monster of the board.

But how do i add players you ask? Well if you hover your mouse over the "Players" section in the top left you can click on "add player"
You then see a form you need to fill out with all the necessary information about a player. You'll see you only need to fill in a little bit as this is the only information you really need while playing.
If you want more information about a player character, simply ask them in person!

Was the session you prepared as DM too hard for your party to handle, and did some of the player characters die? Well they probably had it coming, right?
Well you can simply delete that player by clicking on "Delete Player" button under the information of said player. May he rest in piece...

---Technical issues and shortcomings--------
I ran into a LOT of issues making this the way it is. My biggest problem was reading and writing to my Json files.
This was mainly because if the file was not in the same package as the class trying to acces it. I would get a FileNotFoundException.
I "Fixed" this problem by simply putting all the classes that needed access to the json files in the same package.

Another problem was loading the entire Monster Compendium of over 300 monster into my application. Again this was mainly because it was a FileNotFoundException,
But also with sending the GET requests. But after some time spend figuring that out it also worked.

Then i needed to spend extra time on my login screen. The first time i made it i didnt use the grid function in CSS. This was a big problem because everything was all over the place if you changed the resolution of the window.
But after learing grid and playing around with it i got it working and now have a grid in a grid in a grid, if that makes sense.

I also tried to have a load/save system into the application but i couldn't get it to work. The idea was that the moment you register an account,
your account is also given a key that is generated by using the UUID java class. This class generates a large random string so the chance of getting the same key is so redundantly small its dismissible.

This key would also be used to make a saveFile class. In the saveFile class are all the ArrayLists saved with the created players and selected monsters.
But because the selected monster were only usable in HTML code i couldn't get it to work.
I tried, after adding the selected monster and all of its information to the monster-container in my html code, also adding just the monster's name to a hidden form, and later submitting that form to a "POST" request.
But after many, many tries i couldn't make it work.

Then i tried to add an ArrayList with all the selected monsters in it. But that caused some problems on my back end and i was forced to rollback to an older working version.

------Conclusion---------
This was very fun to make and i'm really happy with the end result. It's a shame the load/save function doesn't work but i'm still glad the rest does.
